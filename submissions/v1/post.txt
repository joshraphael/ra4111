Hi, I would like to request the Jr Dev role to make a set for Monster Max on the Game Boy https://retroachievements.org/game/4111 . I have read the developer documents, made code notes, local achievements, badges, rich presence and leaderboards for this game already. My RetroAcheivement account is https://retroachievements.org/user/joshraphael and my set plan is here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z5Bw3QppAm6bqPBeblPvPgP6ahcfbBBraDd2lthUVr4/edit?gid=0#gid=0
